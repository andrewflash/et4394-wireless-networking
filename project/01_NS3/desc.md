# Project Assignment
## Task
Using NS-3 test IEEE 802.11b performance vs number of stations
## Specifics 
* Setup x WiFi nodes in an infrastructure mode (1 Access Point) and 
experiment with the all parameters that NS3 WiFi helper allows 
* The more scenarios you can generate-the better! 
* Pick one (the bare minimum) for tomorrow and report it to Amjad 
* Scripts for inspection: **10 March** 
* Write down everything in one script: 
  1. analysis
  2. simulations
  3. plotting
* Proper result presentation: error bars, many runs to obtain results 
Use [GitHub.com](http://www.github.com) to store your code 
* Use LaTeX only
