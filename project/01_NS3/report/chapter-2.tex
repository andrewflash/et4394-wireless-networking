\chapter{Project Description}

\section{Objective}

In this project, the density of users, location, and mobility that predominantly affect the fairness of the throughput of the network will be investigated. Moreover, it is quite interesting to consider several network parameters regarding the flow of packets, such as data rate, and payload size. Probably, such kind of parameters may also affect the performance of the network.


\section{Hypothesis}

The increasing number of users or nodes, in any circumstances, will reduce the throughput and thus lower the performance of the network. The reason for this is that the probability of contention in available channels is increasing whenever the number of nodes is also increasing. Contention will add delay and thus lower the throughput. Theoretically, the maximum throughput will be achieved whenever there is only one node inside the network. Once new nodes are added to the network, the network capacity will be shared across all nodes, reducing the average throughput of the network.
