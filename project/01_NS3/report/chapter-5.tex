\chapter{Conclusion}

From the simulation results, we can conclude that in any circumstences, the average throughput of the system goes down as the number of users increases. This because the nature of shared medium, the more the user, the smaller average throughput. The use of RTS/CTS, which is part of IEEE DCF, is intended to solve hidden and exposed node. In a system where hidden and exposed node problem is non-exists, it gives the lower throughput instead of giving advantage to the performance of the system.
